# XTern Artificial Intelligence Work Prompt
This is an AI ML model created for a Food Truck to predict the order of a student given their Year/Major/University/Time. Coded in a Jupyter Notebook, it allows one to see all documentation, code, and results at once. The model uses a Random Forest model to train the already collected student data given by Xtern_TrainData.csv.

### Author
The XTernAI.ipynb in this repository was created by Ben Eng. The initial data file was provided by XTern. Any questions can be directed to eng-ben@outlook.com.

## Usage
To view the ML model, open up the XTernAI.ipynb file. The notebook is split into 4 sections, corresponding with each XTern prompt. All code and visuals are embedded inside the jupyter notebook in cells.
